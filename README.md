# Mathematical Bitcoin and Bitcoinical Mathematics
We have mathematical physics, mathematical philosophy, and other "mathematical _____" subjects of study, so why not Mathematical Bitcoin?
The purpose of this repository is to attempt to develop bitcoin from first principles using concepts from mathematics. Perhaps once/if this is achieved, then there can be another body of work that begins developing which we might dub "Bitcoinical Mathematics." The former (Mathematical Bitcoin) is
using math to study or otherwise "speak" the language of bitcoin, if such a language exists. The latter is the study of actually performing/doing/creating/discovering math within the context of bitcoin itself. 

## Disclaimer
This is currently mostly just a playground for one author to muse about fusing together aspects of mathematics and Bitcoin. As such, it is not even remotely "formal enough" to pass mathematical scrutiny. Nor is it "cypherpunk enough" to be useful for bitcoin. Hopefully, in time, both of those things will be remedied. However, for now, these musings are simply half baked and will likely remain so for quite some time as the author grapples to better understand both mathematics and bitcoin.

## What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
Being able to describe bitcoin in purely abstract mathematical terms may provide some fresh insights. Of course, there are many other mathematical models which have been put forth by the academic and bitcoin community. However, most of those models are purpose built for doing things like analyzing incentives of mining, or determining properties of the network. Instead, what we are working on here is an abstract mathematical model that may facilitate high level, yet consistent-across-implementations, methods of interacting with the Bitcoin network. In other words, interacting with the model that is (hopefully, eventually) developed here will also entail interaction with the bitcoin network directly.
